# Release Engineering Working Group

A working group is dedicated to release engineering and optimization for MLOps and data science teams that use ODH. This group will be responsible for designing, developing, and documenting a unified set of methods and tooling needed by MLOps teams to ensure that their ML models are performing well in production and are maximizing business value. We will focus on use-cases that encompass automated traffic engineering for new versions of ML models in an ODH cluster, and automated validation of ML model versions in production using their performance, business, and ML metrics.

## Goals

* Establish a framework for release optimization and engineering in the ODH ecosystem.
* Provide tools to MLOps teams using ODH for automating the following use-cases:
    - Reliable and automated traffic engineering: blue-green, canary, and mirroring
    - Metrics-driven validation: A/B/n testing, performance testing
    - Metrics-driven validation (future roadmap): Golden testing, drift detection

## Deliverables

* Provide Iter8 extension for ODH
* Provide documentation for how ODH users can implement various release optimization use-cases using Iter8 and KServe modelmesh.
