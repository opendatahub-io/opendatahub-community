# AI Explainability Working Group

A Working Group dedicated to establishing (designing, developing and documenting) an explainability framework for ODH developers (based on TrustyAI explainability toolkit). 
Explanations are useful tools in order to:
Establish trust in predictive models created / used in ODH, especially when deployed in decision making pipelines, e.g. provide explanations together with predictions to end users to allow humans to take better informed decisions
Debug predictions made by predictive models created / used in ODH, e.g. detect (portions of) model input that are responsible for counterintuitive predictions
Get a global understanding of general behavior of predictive models, e.g. which features does a model mostly attend to?

## Goals

* Establish a framework for the inclusion of explainability algorithms/capabilities in the Open Data Hub ecosystem in a cohesive and unified manner.
* Provide tools to ODH developers for explaining predictions made by predictive models.
* Provide tools to ODH developers for global model explainability. 

## Deliverables

* Provide TrustyAI-enabled JupyterHub extension for ODH.
* Implement a _local_ explainability visualization.
* Implement a _global_ explainability visualization.
