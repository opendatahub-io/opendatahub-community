## Governance
Open Data Hub has the following types of groups that are officially supported:
- **Steering Committee** is the governing body of the Open Data Hub project tasked with taking on sensitive topics, providing strategic direction, decision-making and oversight.
- **Special Interest Groups (SIGs)** are persistent open groups that focus on a part of the project. SIGs must have open and transparent proceedings. Anyone is welcome to participate and contribute provided they follow the Open Data Hub Code of Conduct. The purpose of a SIG is to own and develop a set of subprojects.
  - **Subprojects** Each SIG can have a set of subprojects. These are smaller groups that can work independently. Some subprojects will be part of the main Open Data Hub deliverables while others will be more speculative.

See the full [governance document](./governance.md) for more details on these groups.

## Contribute

# As of April 2023, we have moved to [main](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/opendatahub-community/tree/main) as the default branch for this repository.

A first step to contributing is to pick from the list of Open Data Hub SIGs. Start attending SIG meetings, join the slack channel and subscribe to the mailing list. Subprojects in the SIGs will often have a set of "help wanted" issues that can help new contributors get involved.

The [Contributor Guide](./contributing.md) provides help on how to get your ideas and bug fixes seen and accepted.


## Membership
We encourage all contributors to become members. We aim to grow an active, healthy community of contributors, reviewers, and code owners. Learn more about requirements and responsibilities of membership in our [Community Membership page](./community-membership.md).
